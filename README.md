MITS_AIBIRDS is a repository for SIMS (Similarity Score)Python package that provides easy-to-use functions for calculating various similarity scores, including Jaccard, Overlap, and Hamming Distance. These scores can be useful in a wide range of applications, such as text analysis, bioinformatics, and data science.

## Features

- **Jaccard Coefficient**: Measures the similarity between two sets by dividing the size of the intersection by the size of the union.
- **Overlap Coefficient**: Calculates the overlap between two sets by dividing the size of the intersection by the size of the smaller set.
- **Hamming Distance**: Measures the number of positions at which the corresponding elements are different between two strings of equal length.

## Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install simscore
```
# How to Use
After installing the package
1. import similarity_check.Similarity as variable_name
2. Use this variable_name: <br>
Create an object as obj=variable_name.Similarity()
3. Now, you can use this obj to implement anyone of the following functions:
    <br>jaccard_coefficient
    <br>hamming_distance
    <br>overlap_coefficient
