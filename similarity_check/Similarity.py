    """
    The class provides various similarity and dissimilarity methods including jaccard_coefficient,overlap_coefficient and hamming_distance
    Attributes:
    ----------
        str1 :str
            The first attribute for comparison. This can be any string that will be converted into a set.
        str2 :str
            The second attribute for comparison. This can be any string that will be converted into a set.
     Methods
    -------
     jaccard_coefficient( str1, str2)
        Calculates the Jaccard similarity coefficient between two sets.

    overlap_coefficient(str1, str2)
        Calculates the Overlap coefficient between two  sets.

    hamming_distance(str1, str2)
        Calculates the Hamming distance between two strings.
